            <h2>Kinematics</h2>
            <p>Kinematics is the study of motion without considering its causes. In the context of guns, kinematics helps us understand the trajectory of projectiles and the factors that affect their motion.</p>
            The study is often referred to as the geometry of motion, and it models these motions mathematically using algebra.

            <h2>Physics of Guns</h2>
            <p>The physics of guns involves concepts like velocity, acceleration, forces, and energy. These principles govern how guns function, from firing mechanisms to bullet trajectories.</p><br>
            <h1>Efficiency of Firearms</h1>
            From a thermodynamic point of view, a firearm is a special type of piston engine, or in general heat engine where the bullet has a function of a piston. 
            The energy conversion efficiency of a firearm strongly depends on its construction, especially on its caliber and barrel length. 
            However, for illustration, here is the energy balance of a typical small firearm for .300 Hawk ammunition.<br>
            <ul unordered>
                <li>Barrel friction 2%</li>
                <li>Projectile motion 32%</li>
                <li>Hot gases 34%</li>
                <li>Barrel heat 30%</li>
                <li>Unburned propellant 1%</li>
            </ul>
            Higher efficiency can be achieved in longer barrel firearms because they have better volume ratio. 
            However, the efficiency gain is less than corresponding to the volume ratio, because the expansion is not truly adiabatic and burnt gas becomes cold faster because of exchange of heat with the barrel. 
            Large firearms (such as cannons) achieve smaller barrel-heating loss because they have better volume-to-surface ratio. 
            High barrel diameter is also helpful because lower barrel friction is induced by sealing compared to the accelerating force.<br>
            The force is proportional to the square of the barrel diameter while sealing needs are proportional to the perimeter by the same pressure.

        <h1>Force</h1>
        According to Newtonian mechanics, if the gun and shooter are at rest initially, the force on the bullet will be equal to that on the gun-shooter. 
        This is due to Newton's third law of motion (For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction).
         Consider a system where the gun and shooter have a combined mass mg and the bullet has a mass mb. When the gun is fired, the two masses move away from one another with velocities vg and vb respectively.
          But the law of conservation of momentum states that the magnitudes of their momenta must be equal, and as momentum is a vector quantity and their directions are opposite.<br>

          In technical mathematical terms, the derivative of momentum with respect to time is force, which implies the force on the bullet will equal the force on the gun, and the momentum of the bullet/shooter can be derived via integrating the force-time function of the bullet or shooter. 
          Gunshot victims frequently fall or collapse when shot; this is less a result of the momentum of the bullet pushing them over, but is primarily caused by physical damage or psychological effects, perhaps combined with being off balance. 
          This is not the case if the victim is hit by heavier projectiles such as 20 mm cannon shell, where the momentum effects can be enormous; this is why very few such weapons can be fired without being mounted on a weapons platform or involve a recoilless system (e.g. a recoilless rifle).<br><br>

          Example: A .44 Remington Magnum with a 240-grain (0.016 kg) jacketed bullet is fired at 1,180 feet per second (360 m/s)[2] at a 170-pound (77 kg) target. What velocity is imparted to the target (assume the bullet remains embedded in the target and thus practically loses all its velocity)?
         Let mb and vb stand for the mass and velocity of the bullet, the latter just before hitting the target, and let mt and vt stand for the mass and velocity of the target after being hit. Conservation of momentum requires
         mbvb = mtvt.
          Solving for the target's velocity gives
          vt = mbvb / mt = 0.016 kg Ã— 360 m/s / 77 kg = 0.07 m/s = 0.17 mph.
          This example shows the target barely moves at all. That's not to say one couldn't stop a train by firing bullets at it, it's just completely impractical.<br><br>
